```javascript
//tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'theme-color': '#000',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
Ensure that all files where you intend to use Tailwind CSS classes are correctly listed in the `content` property of your `tailwind.config.js` file.  Also verify that your custom theme or any extensions to the default theme are correctly defined and applied.
If you are using custom plugins make sure that they are correctly imported and configured in your `tailwind.config.js` file.  Double-check your class names to ensure that they match the names specified in your `theme` object or plugin imports.
